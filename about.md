<p>Currently, I hold the position of Lead Software Engineer at Fueled, an award-winning technology consultancy firm catering to high-profile clients. With over 15 years of experience, my journey began with C and C++ as I developed applications for desktops and computer games. Later, I made the transition to mobile development, where I gained valuable experience working with Android and iOS platforms. However, my passion lies predominantly in backend development, which led me to specialize in Python, accumulating approximately 10 years of expertise with the language. Over time, I expanded my skillset by mastering Go and TypeScript, becoming proficient in all three languages.</p>

<p>Additionally, I am highly skilled in Cloud computing, Kubernetes, and Serverless technologies, with practical experience working with AWS Amazon, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure platforms. Notably, I have successfully managed Kubernetes clusters with more than 2000 pods, serving numerous connected clients.</p>

<p>In recent years, I have also acted as a full-stack developer, utilizing React for frontend development.</p>

<p>I take great pleasure in problem-solving, as it remains one of my primary motivators. My effective communication skills allow me to articulate and describe problems effectively, and I excel at asking thoughtful questions. Moreover, I possess a resilient nature, which enables me to face challenges with determination and perseverance.</p>
