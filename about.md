### Beginning

My first contact with programming and computers was when I was 8 years old. At the time, the school I attended received some donated computers. Because I was, let’s say, a different kind of kid, drawing electronic circuits in my notebook instead of learning my native language, I was chosen to take a course in the [LOGO](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)>) language. This language was created to teach programming to children. At in time, I also learned [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC).

After that, years passed, and coming from a poor family, it took a while for me to have a computer at home. But when I finally got one, the first thing I did was install Linux on it. The distribution I chose was Slackware. At the time, I wanted to be a hacker, and I was told that I should learn C. So, I spent a good amount of time studying it. Later on, my focus shifted towards game development. I spent years writing a C++ 2D engine based on [SDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_DirectMedia_Layer), [boost](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boost_(C%2B%2B_libraries)>), [OpenGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL), [OpenAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAL), and [Lua](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)>) for scripting.

I participated in groups and made numerous friends in the game development field. However, as I got older, my parents started pressuring me to get a job. So, I distributed my resume in the city. I hoped to get a job as a hardware maintenance technician. But someone at a company saw my 2D engine, called [Wintermoon](https://github.com/skhaz/wintermoon), on my resume and invited me for an interview. That's where it all began. During the interview, I presented the code and showed a demo, and I was hired on the spot. This story was just the beginning of my journey.

### Past

I started my journey as an ERP systems developer. However, that wasn't enough for me. I moved to an indoor media company, and they had a media distribution problem. The server was located in-house with a 1Mbps connection, causing hours of delay in adding new files. I suggested using the [BitTorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) protocol since [CDNs (Content delivery network)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) were extremely expensive and rare at the time. It was a great success, and videos were available within minutes.
At that time, I always had the desire to return to game development. I managed to get an opportunity at a company in Curitiba. I embarked on an incredible journey, relocating to a new city and state. I was entirely responsible for developing a [2D point & click game from scratch](https://www.bigfishgames.com/blog/walkthroughs/blood-oath.html).

After that, I joined a military combat software company where I faced various challenges, such as integrating vest hardware with software and synchronizing six screens of the battle simulator with the platform. This platform included a gun that emitted an infrared beam, captured by one of the six cameras, and the projection was calculated.

Next, I worked in educational technology in Brazil. The use of mobile phones or tablets was not common, so we were pioneers in incorporating them into education. I was tasked with discovering and utilizing Adobe technologies to create a digital book.
While still at the digital books company, I was responsible for porting the [Aurélio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurélio_Dictionary) dictionary to iOS and Android. Aurelio is the most important dictionary in the Portuguese language. And so I did, using [Adobe Air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_AIR).

Then, I received an offer to move to São Paulo to work in a [gambling industry](http://www.ortizgaming.com/en/) using modern C++ and [boost](https://www.boost.org). I accepted, and it was an excellent opportunity to meet two unforgettable and exceptional professionals, Wander and Mauro.
At this casino company, I developed a protocol for use in menus, entirely dynamic and flexible between modern C++ and Lua.

So I made a transition to mobile, working at three different companies, with both iOS and Android. The first one was a startup that utilized the [Sem Parar](https://www.semparar.com.br/) payment system. Unfortunately, the startup no longer exists.

The second was [QuintoAndar](https://www.quintoandar.com.br), where I became the first mobile engineer in the company. I was responsible for creating the first three apps, both for iOS and Android.

After that, I joined [R/GA](https://rga.com), one of the largest and most respected digital agencies on the planet. There, I was tasked with working on Next, the digital version of one of Brazil's largest banks, Bradesco.

Then, a unique opportunity arose to return to backend development and work with Python for a company outside of Brazil, [First Foundry](https://www.firstfoundry.co), and remotely. At the time, remote work was extremely rare; this was many years before the pandemic made it commonplace. At this company, I worked on an app and backend for bars and restaurants across the United States, called [TabbedOut](https://tabbedout.com).

Due to my expertise in serverless and cloud technologies, a cryptocurrency fintech called [Blinktrade](https://blinktrade.com) expressed interest and made me an offer to develop a new cryptocurrency trading platform. In addition to working on this new project, Naka, I also worked on the bitcoin exchange. Thanks to my high performance and proficiency in various areas, I was promoted to Chief Technology Officer. Unfortunately, due to a downturn in the cryptocurrency market, investors requested their money back.

So, I moved on to [HostPapa](https://www.hostpapa.com), a Canadian company specializing in web hosting solutions. I essentially worked on WooCart, a platform for managing WordPress & [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com) websites. There, I was responsible for maintaining the code and managing a Kubernetes cluster with hundreds of active clients and thousands of accesses.

### Now

Nowadays, I work at [Fueled](https://fueled.com/) as a Lead Engineer. This company is extremely renowned for its excellence in app development. At Fueled, I've had the opportunity to work on their two biggest clients to date, [Victoria's Secrets](https://www.victoriassecretandco.com/) Community and [NationsBenefits](https://www.nationsbenefits.com). I served as a full-stack developer on one project and as a backend developer on the other. At times, I also assisted with the management of a Kubernetes cluster.
